title:  Can my Wi-Fi deliver the Internet speeds I pay for?

With support from [data.org][data-org],
  we have assembled and deployed a suite of
    tests for home Internet performance.

One of my favorites is a test of home Wi-Fi bandwidths.
In simple terms, our question is:
  if I buy some Internet speed from Comcast,
  can I actually get it from my router to my laptop?
By sticking a speedtest server on the router
  and engaging participants to install a browser
  extension that regularly checks the speed,
  we can monitor the capacity of the local network.
We then compare that capacity with the bandwidth
  measured from the router out to Ookla Speedtest, on the larger Internet.
If your Wi-Fi bandwidth is lower
  than your bandwidth from the ISP,
  you can't get what you're paying for.

A raspberry pi with our 'netrics' package is connected to the router via a gigabit, wired connection.  It then receives tests from a browser extension, and itself runs tests to Ookla Speedtest&reg;." %}

On my own home network, with a dinky 60 Mbps connection,
  this was true fully a quarter of the time over the last two months.
My connection tier is the same one Comcast offers
  through its low-cost [Internet Essentials][comcast-ie] program.
Of course, my _median_ Wi-Fi speed of 245 Mbps exceeds what Comcast delivers,
  and at its best I record over 500 Mbps.
But when there are issues, it's the Wi-Fi.

Looking at participants' data
  from across Chicago,
  the median across households of the median across tests is just 185 Mbps.
In other words, the "average" user got less than 200 Mbps, on average.
Since many people subscribe to Internet contracts 
  with hundreds of megabits per second in the downstream direction, 
  nearly _two-thirds_ of participants' ISPs deliver more to their home
    than their Wi-Fi can deliver to their devices.
For a few tips on setting up your Wi-Fi,
  see my [last post][wifi-setup].

This has important implications, as Congress and the Biden Administration
  weigh investments in broadband infrastructures through the American Recovery Plan.
Personally, I see enormous potential
  for investment in building-level Wi-Fi infrastructures,
  especially in city housing authorities.
This is essentially what groups like
  [Education Superhighway][ed-super] are already doing.
Renting a modem/router combo from an ISP is quite expensive,
  although it is included in the Internet Essentials program.
Installing it requires a real level of expertise.
Why not build out the Wi-Fi professionally,
  and buy fiber "wholesale" for the entire building?
