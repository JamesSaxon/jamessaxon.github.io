Hi, I'm Jamie Saxon.

I work on spatial problems, software / hardware integration, and engineering for large datasets.

I am currently a software engineer at [Mapbox][mapbox], where I transform raw location telemetry
into actionable data.  I've made major contributions to the accuracy of our traffic speeds 
and classification of device modality (walking vs driving).
I also defined and created new [products][michelin-li] for identifying dangerous traffic conditions.

I was originally trained as an experimental particle physicist.
I started working on the [ATLAS experiment][atlas] as a high school student in 2003, 
  and spent many years building electronics, writing firmware, and commissioning large data systems.
I have worked with large datasets since 2009.
As a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania,
  I made [noteworthy][us-atlas] [contributions][atlas-thesis])
  to the discovery and first measurements of the Higgs boson.

I then spent eight years as a researcher the University of Chicago.
As my interests shifted from physics towards geospatial and urban problems,
  I [published](academic) work on gerrymandering, 
  the dynamics of human mobility across neighborhoods,
  access to resources like healthcare, parks, and performant Internet,
  and statistical inference from convenience samples.
Along the way,
  I worked on firmware development,
  learned practical computer vision,
  and taught statistics to graduate students in public policy.

I have two sons, and sometimes aspire to make light-based [art](art).
